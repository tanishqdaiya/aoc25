Advent of Code '25
==================

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025. Although I
have worked with C for quite some time now, I wanted to start things off with
something beautiful and familiar.

I am still learning, so use these solutions for what they're worth. I haven't
uploaded part two solutions yet, but I'll do them when I atleast catch up to the
latest day and besides, they are not really hard after you've laid solid
groundwork. They are subtle additions on the same problem really.
